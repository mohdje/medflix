# WebHostStreaming

This is a web server application implemented using .Net Core. It provides APIs that a client can use to search movies and get a stream to watch a movie. 
This app has been designed to work for a single user usage on a local machine (for the movie playing part) so it can not be easily deployed on a server for a public usage (which would mean legal problems).
